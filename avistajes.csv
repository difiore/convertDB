Get strong signal of grayson. Small male with collar but didn't see tag. No antenna. Dark round balls, quite hairy and a bit very dangly. White dot next to right eye. Hairy chest. 
G-lady (a.k.a. Gladys) with collar, round globular vagina. Pink tip. No baby but big belly. SF or small AF moving close. 
AFD with pink tip clitoris with IX2 (Im almost sure it's a boy) riding dorsally. Clitoris more whiteish than bright pink. Had a ""turupe"" on top of forehead. JM3 with gray penis tip moving close to AFD. 
SM. Bigger body than the JM3 but balls still attached to body. 
AF. No collar. Also looks pregnant but her body seems smaller in size.  Maybe the same SF I saw earlier. Moving Close to one of the JM3/Sm. 
16:16:50 the am with collar (Grayson?) came into contact to the AFD wih IX2 (think its a male) and started inspecting the baby. The baby crawled to his head while still on mom. 16:18:51 looks like the IX2 is grooming the male or at least on top of the male while grabbing I the the branch not mom. The baby is in between the two. 16:20:30 the AM leaves contact/prox. AFD follows Grayson, then the larger jm3/sm, then the smaller AF, then the jm3. Maybe more than just two JMs. 
AF with naked neck following a JM2. 
Gabby also here. Another AF? 
Large AM. Gipmunck? Or maybe Goodwin?balls were big but didn't seem super huge. The large AM didn't go into the Ficus tree from which at least 6 individuals were foraging. 
AFD with IF2. Not sure if t is the same AFD I have seen earlier. It is very likely. Looks very orange. Maybe not. Think I saw another AFD with a IX2. 17:19 (started late) collared male and AFD with IX2 again in contact. I think AM was grooming or inspecting either the AFD or the baby. End at 17:21. 
17:23 some are taking off south west and others more east. Another male with hairy and dangly balls also here but one of them has them way bigger. Probably Gipmunck and Goodwin? At 17:55 leave them.

AFD with no collar carrying an IF3? Probably Cali and Cashu. 
Small SM. Probably Gdubs. Following Gwen. But could also be colugo bc his balls seemed very small (like Gdubs lat year). 
AF followed by SM. Likely Cora and colugo. This is te AF with naked neck. 
Also AM with slightly hairy balls still attached to body. Nocollar. It had the ring finger from right hand broken (don't chromeo have a broken finger?). Still has hairy chest and hairy balls a bit dangly, but not too dangly. Looks smaller to be a BAM. 
Gwapi is a boy unless it has a darkc litoris like mom. 
Gwapi is more like an IM3 than a 2. It get off mom a lot while foraging. Gwapi IS a girl indeed with a dark clitoris!!!
Definitely a Sg. Not sure where Celeste or chloe.

In the morning I see: collared male is chunky and bulky. Not sure whether it qualifies as a BAM. Chest is very hairy and in general he looks very muscular and puffy. His testicles are hairy but not very descended. See another bam with bigger and more dangly balls. Small Subadult male with no decended balls. Tip of penis dark and out a lot.  JM2. JM3 with dark tip penis. Another JM3/sm? This one is another individual different from the other young males but not sure yet whether it is a male. I think it actually was a female with a very short clitoris and looked more like a subadult than an adult but I don't see any other females around so she might be the mom of her JM2 (small but very independent). Not sure if it's the same female, but now I saw one with a larger/longer and more whitish clitoris that seems to have dots but bt sure, also her face was round at the bottom with smallish jowls and the JM1/2 seems to stay within 5-10 mts of her. I think the smallish female is different than the larger one. Definitely at least two juvenile males around. A very small one more like a JM1-2, and another one more like a jm3. The JMs and the females are all very close to each ther. I feel like the smallest jM follows the small AF. The SM also stays close (or larger JM3?). SAM with dark balls but still attached to body. Jowls are noticeable but not super big. Another small AF? Not sure if it's the same one from before... Had pink and short? Clitoris. 
9:30 starting IDs again:
AM with hairy balls a bit dangly. Couldn't tell whether it has a collar or not but it has hairy chest. 
SM with penis tip dark and sticking out.  Close to him is an AFD with iX1 riding ventrally very small. Maybe Oliver and Olivia with new baby?
Maybe another AFD with IX1? Not sure if it's the same one I just saw. Probably bc it's been followed by a SM.

Interesting how the use almost the exact same route as the spiders. 
Check copulation data from Evelyn and bekah last year. 
They move more independent from one another which makes it easier to tell he families apart (unlike G). However, also a lot of individuals... And flood. I really like this area between guacamayo and pp. but maybe just because I am familiar with it. 
AF or SF with pink clitoris and a darker line running in the middle. Pale pink.looks kind of like a coffee bean.  Probably a SF since at 7:46 I saw a larger AF aggressinf her in a feed tree. AF that aggressed has a brighter and bigger clitoris, round, and she looks bulky. Big muscles. 
Also see a SM with lanky body. Maybe a JM3 instead foraging with collared subadultish female in same small tree. Maybe rumba? Has a GPS collar. Tried sinal and it is indeed rumba.

Buff AF darker in color. Pale clitoris I think with a small dent in the middle. 
JM3 with small body but a bit bigger jowls. Has a big head but his body is very round. It is more of a SM since his balls seem a bit hairy and already a bit dangly. Also his mouth sticks out a bit so it looks a bit whiteish. I saw a Sm with small body like a juvenile but bigger balls but still attached to body. Not sure if it is the same sm I saw before.

Small AF or SF with tiny waist. Diya? Maybe one of the JMs is ditto?
The larger female is very dark in color. She has only the tip of the clitotis pink and it's he one that is kind of like an inverted funnel. At the top of tip of clitoris from behind she has a smal pink line running vertically. Maybe Delilah?althou I haven't seen any juvenile females yet.

AFD/If3 probably Cali and Cashu.  Close an AM that has hairy balls but not very big. No collar. Maybe clash? Looks more buff than last year. Also more orange fur on his back but dark hair on belly. Cashu still rides on Cali sometimes while MBT. Clash has a bit of jowls but barely any crests, just a bit. But definitely looks buffer than last year. Just the three of them traveling together. I think. Cali has a pink clitoris that is kind of flat at the bottom. But the pink part is kind of long. At 11:22 I see Cuzco. He was following behind I guess. Email peoe llamado de emergencia. 11:34 saw an AF drinking water from a bromeliad. Maybe another female around. Didn't see Cashu close to that AF. Also looked smaller. 11:43 now I see a jm3. Colugo? There is a large orange female close to him son probably Cora. Orange on the back. But sun hitting her back so not sure. Big oval clitoris and pink. Vagina looks swollen so maybe pregnant? Also see Gwen. Gwapi not riding. 
12:07 I see Cora resting at P1 from an AM? Clash? 12:07:06 colugo approaches to contact and she grooms him. 12:08 she stops but he remains in contact wih Cora and less than p1 wih the male. 12:09:24 colugo moves into contact with the male and stays resting. 12:11:57 clash breaks contact and proximity with colugo and Cora. Cora looks like she might be pregnant. Huge clitoris and swollen vagina. Also saw a SF Chloe sized. Although maybe and most likely is Chalupa who should be bigger now. So chai is probably also around. Gwapi seems to be more independent than Cashu. 12:30 saw chromeo wih group. Probably the ones I'm calling subadult females in D are really juveniles. 13:14 feeding bout in ficus. I think Gdubs arrived last.

Grayson definitely has no tag. His balls are hairy but still attached to body. Moving with a smaller AF with a small light pink clitoris. JM2 with pink tip penis. Small SM or large JM3 wih no clearly visible balls but gray penis sticks out making it seem like he only had one tiny gray testicle. His balls are there but very small. There was another individual that passed by but I couldn't see who it was. 
Also bigger AF followed by a small J2. AF has butt hairs. I think the J2 is a JM2 (but maybe a bit smaller than the other one?) that also has a light tip penis, pinkish but a bit more gray. Females clitoris is very big and has an elongated teardrop and maybe t has some dots? Not sure about the dots. She also has hairy chest and seems to have a bit darker fur. Also seemed to have some white on her labia. Maybe Gemima and genesis? But big clitoris might also be from Godiva. Modify activity field in ranging form. 
Medium AM with some crests, and smallish hairy balls a bit pendulous. Maybe Gordon? 
The two jM2 are very similar in size one slightly larger. The larger one maybe is the one wih a bt darker pink greyish penis tip? Couldn't see the other AF though...
AFD with a small IX2. I think she may be the one that I thoughy looks orangish. Pink small round clitoris. 
One of the AF has a huge clitoris year drop shape. She is followed by the larger JM2 with brighter pink penis. Probably Godiva and goose. Maybe Gemima also has a large clutoris but not as big?
The Sm wih big and gray tip penis also has a bit of hairy on his small balls. The med size SF (I think it's the same I thought could be a small AF) has a very pink clutoris and very round. Was close to the AFD/IX1.5. Maybe Gem? AF followed my jM2 with grayish penisbhas a smallerer dot pink clutoris than the other one. Has darker ventraly fur.  Definitely not as big as AF with isn't clitoris. So these must be Gemima and genesis.

Maybe garayson also has a larger white spot next to left eye. Younger looking female followed by a large JM2 more like jM3 with whitish grayish penis.

Same female wih pink line running down Labia  and skinny narrow ""waist"" where clitoris starts. Maybe he's a different one from the younger looking female. Her body is bigger with shaggy chest hair. Also saw her with a big belly at one point while foragig so need I be careful with that. Female does have a younger face but bigger body. I don't think she's pregnant.

So really doubt she is pregnant. 10:14:17 end nursing. Maybe she also has bare pinkish breasts? Maybe it was just te lighting. 10:24 gipmunk attacks lounging on darker AFD.

It has a not so visible white spot above but right on the middle of his right eyebrow. Maybe the first one was Goodwin? 8:45 see Gladys. Big flattish clitoris. No baby. Her vagina doesn't look as swollen anymore... Maybe she's not pregnant or lost the baby? 8:55 Gordon APA got/GTH to P1. 8:58 Gordon resting in P1 of got/GTH. 8:59:43 Gordon breaks prox but stays in P2. 9:00 Gotham playing solo on top of Gordon while he rests. While resin Gladys also rests within 5 of Gordon and Gotica. 9:02:51 the baby stops solo playing and goes back to where mom is. Not sure anymore whether te baby is a boy or a girl. 9:04:01 Gordon breaks prox. I'm almost sure it's the boy. Pink tip is very much towards tummy not towards anus. There is a JM3 with a very pink tip penis but balls are not very separated. Also the dark JM3/SM and the SM with the pink belly button and dotted penis (Guaponi). I think I also saw gipmunk.

Saw Grayson, Gordon, Gladys, JM3. resting in contact are Grayson with guayaba and guava. Started at least at 6:50. At 7:01 a JM3 was moving in the tree and he started moving slowly towards guayaba. She was looking at him and then longed at him. The jm3 screeched and hen guayaba went back to her resting spot in contact with Grayson. Meanwhile, a smaller individual rests close within 3 m of Grayson and guayaba. Maybe Guazuma? Grayson was initially at a different spot when I first saw them this morning. Guava grabs and touches Grayson a lot while they're resting. Guava stays on mom though. 7:16 guayaba breaks contact and prox. I'm almost sure t was Gyb/GVA but it maybe could've been GTC/GTH. Wen Guayaba left contact she sat within two meets of Grayson as started genital rubbing. Grayson approached her again to contact but laid down again to rest. Seconds layer was when guayaba broke contact and proximity. Grayson stayed resting in his initial spot. 7:20 guayaba approaches Grayson again within less Than a meter. Grayson turns around to face her. They rest. 7:25 GYB breaks p1 wih Grayson but remains within P2. 7:56 guayaba leaves the tree. I think maybe t was Gotica and Gotham. Baby seemed small and then I think I saw a darker jM3 not an SF leaving the tree, but not really sure about this. Both Gotica and guayaba were moving close afterwards.. I think a large AF was also in the tree. Maybe granadilla and the JM3 was granito? She was a darker AF with a large clitoris. Could be Gladys or gasimba. The. I also saw a smaller jm2. So maybe gaston? See another jm2 with pink penis. I think grills and gru may also be here. In general I feel like they've been vocalizing very little...9:37 Gael also in subgroup.

Also saw gasimba and gaston. There are lots of individuals. Saw again grulla and gru. 7:28. Gipmunk seems to be leading the group towards camp. Gipmunk, then Gael (who is starting to look like a bam), then Grayson, then a SM lanky with small hairy balls, I think there is another sm with Gordon sized balls but skinnier?, then gulla and gru, and others are at least 50 m behind. About 50m behind was a SM moving alone. He had a gray tip wide penis. Maybe Guaponi and his penis just looks not as pink? It was big but not quite at belly button height. There are still others way behind. 7:45 I think the group fissioned. The ones I stayed with came to the canal eye tree on Chorongo. There was a lot of chasig and screaming going on in the feeding tree. There I saw a sm, a SF or small AF, ... I think I'm probably with most of the males, grulla and gru which were the ones I saw crossing the camp bridge. Maybe gasimba and gaston also here? (There is a large darker  AF with a large cltoris). Gabby also here. Haven't seen Gladys but her signal is strong without antenna. Maybe Gordon too? There are at least 12 individual in the group I'm with. Also Gotica and Gotham.  Overall I see lots of females in tree. Gipmunk Gael Grayson and probably Goodwin probably are also here. Also Garmin and Garri. Also a darker small AF with small pink clitoris. Maybe Guazuma?

Small AF may be grulla. Didn't see a jm2 close though. There is definitely a small AF and a SF. I now see a jm2. I think Garmin and Garri also here. Saw them when arrived to the LL-16-147 at 7:38. I the tree I see Gordon, Garmin and Garri, Gotica and Gotham. I feel like there is a JM2 or small jm3 that often follows Gotica ad Gotham closely. 7:51 I see Gladys and probably Goodwin going in tree. Also Gael. I think there is another Gordon sized SAM. Also there is a JM3 that cries and screams a lot, but I don't see any aggression. He just runs and screams.8:40 they are now much more spread apart. I only see a SAM, a SM, the crying JM3,  an AFD/IX2, an AF with darker chest hair but lighter dorsal hair and pink teardrop middle sized clitoris. 
Make a focal sample linked to feeding bout but also to biol sample. They went along Q until harpia 500. There I also saw two sm that had a pink penis, a lage male that may be gipmunk, Grayson, an AF with pink line down labia until reachig clitoris. But not grulla. Harpia 500. Forage then rest. Make spreadsheet for poop DNA samples and poop hormone samples for each month? 35 ticks removed just from forearms. There is a SAM similar in size to Gordon with smaller balls and penis sticks out quite a bt. Has some jowls and crests. 17:48 I see kind of a JF3 foraging in the same tree with a small AF. Maybe Gisella and Gigi? However, they both look like subadults. One darker than the ther. The darker one is more Chloe sized 2015. The blondish one is larger.

JF3, AF (chai and chalupa?). 
SF or AF with lighter reddish back and very dark hairy chest and tummy. 
AM with broken ring finger on right hand (chromeo - definitely looks smaller than g males). 
SF. Not sure if it's the same I saw before.

6:55 chromeo and Gwen doing lots of alarm calling. Not sure of its because of me. 
Gwen and Gwapi. Gwapi still riding but he looks huge! She still had the collar but no tag. Gwapi is probably a JM1 now. 
Maybe Cashu is not that much smaller than Gwapi. They both look huge when riding their moms. 
I don't think chai looks pregnant. 
8:23 I see clash. Or an AM with no collar. 
8:25 saw an AF teeth chattering towards clash. There was a young JF1close. I think it was Cali! Wtf!!! The am has smallish balls that still look attached to body. But his body is stocky so I really doubt it's Gdubs. Balls are big but hairless and not very pendulous. Cali and clash went off together to forage separate from the rest of the group. 8:48 saw her again TC towards Clash. Clash just looked at her but stayed resting. 
9:00 Cali solicit clash. Check voice memo on phone. Then they went up to a tangle and I couldn't see ten but they were is proximity. Then from ~9:15 they rested within 5 of each other. 
Chai is very orange on the top. She does sometimes looks kind of wide choose fully not pregnant. 
Gwapi's feet fort even fit and are just hanging off from Gwen. 
Cuzco's balls are hairier than Clash's. 
Cora does have a new baby. Baby is small, less than a month old. Looks like the baby from Gladys, maybe a bit bigger. Cora followed by colugo and a SF that I assume is still Celeste? Or maybe Chloe?

Alejandra spotted the monkeys at 07:42 in front of the researchers/tigres cabins. From there they moved up the hill along Lago towards the location of the speaker. At 07:50 they were roughly 25 meters from the speaker. From there Kong moved to R trail near CD-11-067. Eventually we lost him there. I moved back to the speaker to see if he went back to where we last saw Katta and INF16. I saw him running off to the tigres cabin when I got there. We followed him to just north of the generators and eventually lost him out of sight. All three of us walked back to the speaker over a different trail and we found Katta and INF16 when we got there. Katta managed to escape our attention, so we stayed with INF16 (at 09:14 in CD-13-031). A few minutes later another individual is close by (likely Katta). They move to alongside the septic tank and from there we can see Kong too who is hanging out down the hill in the flooded part. INF16 chirruped and sounded exactly as the adults at 09:48.

5) one of the females presented to a male (i.e. Backside to him with teeth barred). He sniffed her clitoris and walked away about a meter. She followed and after a moment he mounted her. Pelvic motion seen.
6) one female potentially has a scar/bald spot on right(?) side of neck. Only visible when head is raised. Maybe just my imagination...

2) infant riding mother's back present. I believe there is a second infant as well. Saw a bulge on another female's stomach that looked infant-like. Definitely a second infant present.
One of these infants seen moving on its own with mother nearby. Jumped on her back within a few meters. Mother is fairly small adult female. 
3) young/small adult male(?) with potential scar/weird fur patch on rear left leg. Definitely a scar. Runs down most of the outside of the lower portion of the leg.
4) adult female without infant present. Fairly small.
5) I think there are 3 infants in this group. Two moms with riding infants seen in close proximity. The other hasn't been seen around the other moms but potentially around another adult female without an infant.
6) 11:10- just went to find Aragorn. I would say he was definitely still with the same group but way out on the edge. Seems to be associated with one or two others of his own age. One seems to be a female. Other is male with scarred leg.
7) 15:50. I really hope this is the same subgroup. 
8) Large adult male. Very chunky. Lots of fur around testicles.
9) at least one other small adult male present without scar.

6) infant riding mother present. Riding her back. Infant looks very small but could've been one of the independently moving individuals from before. Seen moving independently for a brief period before getting back on mom.
7) I think I've seen a large adult male with broken middle finger on front right but I'm not positive.
8) Large adult male with very large cheeks present. 4-leafed clover shaped head. I think all fingers were intact though.
9) 2 young adult males eating in the same tree. Both pretty small. I wonder if these are the two that I've seen playing together a couple times.
10) I believe one of the infants is a male. No pink spot seen. 
   -11:30 for about the past hour I have been following this infant and it's mother. No idea where the rest of the group went. Seemed like they were spreading out and then I was alone with these two.

12) 2 smaller adult males and 1 female foraging in same tree. Have been in fairly close proximity for a bit now. Potentially the two young males from before?

5) I think I saw another infant riding a stomach. Hard to say though, it was really brief. Definitely at least 2 present. 2 mothers carrying infants seen in association (in same tree while foraging)
6) Small adult female. No infant. Looked like a very pink clitoris
7) Large adult male. Very bulky. Fairly large testes. Broken pinky on front right hand. I think it is the pinky. I may have noted this same male as having a broken ring finger before but maybe that digit sticks out with the broken one. Maybe vice-versa... Could be a broken ring/middle finger... Potentially has a white patch on tail(?)
8) 10:23- Second time this morning they've been purely silent. I think they're sleeping but some small movements seen
       -I think the large adult male is in a sleeping tree with at least 1 maybe 2 females with infants

4) small adult female w/out infant present. Seen near larger adult female without infant.

6) Hypothesis: I think there are at least 3 large adult males. Potentially 2 with broken fingers and 1 without. One that I have seen I believe has something funky with his testes as I think I have seen an additional lump from behind. The male without broken fingers is fairly round (i.e. Big belly)
